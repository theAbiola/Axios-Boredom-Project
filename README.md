# Axios-Boredom-Project
In this project, I use the Axios API Library to structure API requests to the Bored-API, which is a public API. My ExpressJS application generates a random activity and displays it to users on the frontend in order to help them overcome boredom.

1. To run the code for this project, use the `cd` command to navigate to the project folder.
2. use the `npm i` command to install all the npm packages specified in the package.json file.
3. Since the application uses environment variables, you'd have to specify the application port in order to access the visualisation of the interface on the client-side.
4.Get the API URL for the bored API from `https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/` and assign it as the value of the API_URL const.
5. Use `node index.js` to run the Application with node.
